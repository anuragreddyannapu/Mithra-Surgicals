                The Indian Orthopaedic Research Group was started in 2007, however 2011 was the year that established IORG as a cohesive group with a definite direction and aim. It was the year that IORG became one of the fore front organisation of Indian Orthopaedics with a unique agenda of Research and Collaboration. We became one of the largest online communities in Orthopaedics 
                and our Case discussion forum had more than 500 cases being discussed every month and more than 20 thousand Comments every month. We started the IORG Associate membership which had a good response along with the IORG website. IORG website has become a unique portal for all Orthopods, where they can showcase their presentations, find information and also get information 
                about the work of IORG.

Our Latest venture OrthoTV has received great response and our whtasapp and telegram forums have solidified into essential portals for any orthopod in the country. However we think we have not even started in our Journey of making India leader in Orthopaedic Research in the world. We would need support from all of you to realise this core dream of ours. In next one week we will announce some more ventures and portals that will help us further our goal of Improving Research Scenario in the Country. With expansion of our various ventures there is immense strain on our resources and we would request the orthopaedic community to help us by donating to IORG. We assure you that all money will be used for betterment of Orthopaedic research in India and also invested in various ventures like OrthoTV and Journals. Use the link below to Donate:
